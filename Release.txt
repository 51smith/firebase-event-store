2.0.4
* Injected ITracer interface to FirestoreEventStore and CommandHandler for tracing and stat collection
* Removed creator parameter from Aggregate.addEvent, the actor id and command name are now passed internally by the event store when committing events 
* Replaced Bus with CommandHandler extending IBus
* Created CommandMapper to map commands to Aggregate types
* IEventStore.commitEvents now returning committed events instead of Aggregate and accepting actor and command name
* Simpler IBus only responsible for event handling

2.1.0
* Replaced CommandHandler with Bus now implementing command side and Kafka style pub/sub messaging where consumers are subscribed to a stream and 
  stream readers keep pushing events from log and record the latest consumed versions
* Removed pump from event handlers and bus
* Added name and stream to event handlers so they can be subscribed to the bus and wait for events to be pushed
* Added loadEvents, getStreamData, and commitCursors methods to event store to support pub/sub storage of consumer positions (cursors)

* Implemented PushWindow and StreamReader to support pushing events to subscribed consumers

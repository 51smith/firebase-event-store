2.0.4
* Injected ITracer interface to FirestoreEventStore and CommandHandler for tracing and stat collection
* Removed creator parameter from Aggregate.addEvent, the actor id and command name are now passed internally by the event store when committing events 
* Replaced Bus with CommandHandler extending IBus
* Created CommandMapper to map commands to Aggregate types
* IEventStore.commitEvents now returning committed events instead of Aggregate and accepting actor and command name
* Simpler IBus only responsible for event handling
* Removed actor and aggregate from IEventHandler events signature. Committed events that are published to handlers contain actor id, aggregate id, and command name

2.1.0
* Replaced CommandHandler with Bus now implementing command side and Kafka style pub/sub messaging where consumers are subscribed to a stream and 
  stream readers keep pushing events from log and record the latest consumed versions
* Removed pump from event handlers and bus
* Added name and stream to event handlers so they can be subscribed to the bus and wait for events to be pushed
* Added loadEvents, getStreamData, and commitCursors methods to event store to support pub/sub storage of consumer positions (cursors)
* Modified ITracer to accept a lazy function that will be called only by concrete tracers
* Implemented PushWindow and StreamReader to support pushing events to subscribed consumers

2.1.1
* Added poll function to bus allowing pull mode (when multiple buses are interested in listening)
* Encapsulated some of the private stuff in the bus

2.1.2
* Passing tenant id to event handlers

2.1.3
* Fixed event pushing queue in bus
* Simplified tracers
* Simplified stream reader

2.1.4
* Moved promise queue logic from bus to stream reader so every reader has an independent queue

2.1.5
* Fixed concurrency issues with promise queue, firestore store using transactions to commit new events

2.1.6
* Implemented in-memory aggregate cache in bus to avoid unnecessary loading
* Fixed promise queue to enqueue next promise after exception

2.1.7
* Added _t (aggregate type) property to events to allow same aggregate id on multiple types in same stream
